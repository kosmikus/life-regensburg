life-regensburg
===============

Simple Game of Life implementation, originally developed at a Regensburg Haskell meeting

Adapted for a lecture at Technische Hochschule Nürnberg

The master branch contains a version with "full" support for the RLE format for which
many example files can be found online. It also has an "aging" feature.

The th-n branch contains a version that is very close to what was actually developed during
the Nürnberg lecture.
